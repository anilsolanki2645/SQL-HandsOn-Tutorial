# SQL-HandsOn-Tutorial

Welcome to the SQL Commands Practice Repository! This repository is designed to provide hands-on exercises for mastering SQL commands across four main categories: Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Control Language (DCL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Transaction Control Language (TCL).

## Introduction

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for managing and manipulating relational databases. This repository aims to provide comprehensive practice opportunities covering a wide range of SQL commands, organized into distinct categories.

## Categories

### Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL commands are used to define, modify, and delete the structure of database objects such as tables, indexes, and views. These commands include `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, and `RENAME`.

### Data Control Language (DCL)

DCL commands are used to control access to data within the database. These commands include `GRANT`, `REVOKE`, and `DENY`, allowing users to grant or revoke permissions on database objects to other users.

### Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DML commands are used to manipulate data within database objects such as tables. These commands include `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`, enabling users to retrieve, add, modify, and remove data from the database.

### Transaction Control Language (TCL)

TCL commands are used to manage transactions within the database. Transactions ensure the integrity and consistency of data by allowing users to control the beginning, ending, and rollback of transactions. TCL commands include `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT`.
